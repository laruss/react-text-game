Defined in: [types.ts:76](https://github.com/laruss/react-text-game/blob/7b0de9d1745a4d5d61bf751fa93c904f39754886/packages/devtools/src/types.ts#L76)

How much attention a difference deserves.

- `error` - old saves break or lose data without a migration
- `warning` - a human has to decide; usually a suspected rename
- `info` - harmless, recorded so the diff is complete
